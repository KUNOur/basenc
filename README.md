Basenc
======

Basenc is a library used to encode data into a human-readable encoding format.

Supported Encodings
-------------------

- Base32

Base32
------

The version of Base32 supported by this project is that defined in
[RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).

How to Build
------------

This project can use GNU Autotools to build itself. To create the proper
configuration scripts, run

	autoreconf -iv

or

	./buildprep

You should then be able to build this with the standard

	./configure
	make
	make install

This project can also use the CMake build system. To build the basenc library
(libbasenc), do the following in the top-level directory:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

base32enc
---------

There is an included command-line tool (called "base32enc") that can be used to
encode data to Base32. It can be used either from the command line (send an EOF
character ^D to stop) or it can encode a file. Its output will always be sent to
stdout.
