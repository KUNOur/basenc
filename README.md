Basenc
======

Basenc is a library used to encode data into a human-readable encoding format.

Supported Encodings
-------------------

- Base32
- Base64

Base32 and Base64
-----------------

The version of Base32 and Base64 supported by this project are defined in
[RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).

How to Build
------------

This project can use GNU Autotools to build itself. To create the proper
configuration scripts, run

	autoreconf -iv

or

	./buildprep

You should then be able to build this with the standard

	./configure
	make
	make install

This project can also use the CMake build system. To build the basenc library
(libbasenc), do the following in the top-level directory:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

A Note on Testing
-----------------

The unit tests used by this project are written using the
[Check Unit Testing Framework](http://check.sourceforge.net/) and are run
using the build scripts generated by Autotools. To run the tests, run

	make check

after having built with Autotools, as described above.

baseXXenc
---------

There are included command-line tools (called "base32enc" and "base64enc") that
can be used to encode data to Base32. It can be used either from the command
line (send an EOF character ^D to stop) or it can encode a file. Its output
will always be sent to stdout.
